CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST

Study Date: February 15, 2024
Study ID: CT2024001
Patient: MRN0000000
DOB: 1990-01-01

CLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain, evaluate for nephrolithiasis.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without intravenous contrast.

COMPARISON: None available.

FINDINGS:

Kidneys/Ureters: Multiple small calculi are noted in the left kidney measuring up to 4 mm. A 6 mm non-obstructing calculus is present in the distal left ureter. The right kidney demonstrates a 3 mm non-obstructing calculus in the lower pole.

Liver: The liver demonstrates diffuse low attenuation consistent with hepatic steatosis. A 1.2 cm hypodense lesion is identified in segment 6, indeterminate but likely representing a simple cyst versus hemangioma. Recommend MRI or ultrasound for further characterization.

Gallbladder: Unremarkable.

Pancreas: Normal attenuation and morphology.

Spleen: Normal size and attenuation.

Adrenals: Unremarkable bilaterally.

Bowel: No evidence of obstruction, wall thickening, or pneumatosis.

Peritoneum: No ascites or free air.

Bones: Diffuse osteopenia is noted throughout the visualized skeleton.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple urinary tract calculi as described, including left kidney and bilateral ureteral stones, the largest in the distal left ureter measuring 6 mm.
2. Hepatic steatosis with indeterminate 1.2 cm liver lesion in segment 6. Recommend further characterization with MRI or ultrasound.
3. Diffuse osteopenia.
