CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: Follow-up renal stones

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis dated 8/26/2009

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without intravenous contrast.

FINDINGS:

Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi are again noted. The largest stone measures 8 mm in the lower pole of the left kidney, previously 7 mm. A 6 mm stone is present in the right kidney mid pole, previously 5 mm. Multiple additional smaller bilateral renal stones are noted, with minimally increased overall stone burden compared to prior exam.

Within the right lobe of the liver, there is a 1.6 cm hypodense lesion that is incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study. This was not present on the prior CT from 2009. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.

Diffuse osteopenia is noted, most pronounced in the visualized thoracic spine.

The visualized portions of the lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and gallbladder appear unremarkable.

No free fluid or free air within the abdomen or pelvis.

No suspicious osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi with minimally increased burden since prior CT.
2. Indeterminate 1.6 cm liver lesion requiring further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI.
3. Diffuse osteopenia noted, most pronounced in thoracic spine.
