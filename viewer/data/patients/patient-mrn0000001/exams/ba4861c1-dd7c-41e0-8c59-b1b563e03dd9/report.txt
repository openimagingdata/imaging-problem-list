**Abdominal Ultrasound**

**Date of Exam:** February 8, 2022

**Technique:**
Real-time grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen was performed.

**Indication:**
60-year-old male with right upper quadrant discomfort, evaluate for cholelithiasis.

**Comparison:**
None available.

### **Findings:**

**Liver:**
The liver is normal in size measuring 16 cm in craniocaudal dimension. The hepatic parenchyma demonstrates diffusely increased echogenicity consistent with hepatic steatosis. No focal mass lesion identified. The hepatic veins and portal vein are patent with normal flow direction.

**Gallbladder:**
The gallbladder is non-distended and contains multiple mobile echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing consistent with cholelithiasis. The largest stone measures 7 mm. The gallbladder wall measures 2 mm, within normal limits. No pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic Murphy sign is negative.

**Biliary System:**
The common bile duct measures 4 mm, within normal limits. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

**Pancreas:**
The pancreatic head and body are visualized and appear normal. The tail is obscured by overlying bowel gas.

**Spleen:**
The spleen is normal in size measuring 10 cm in craniocaudal dimension. Normal echotexture.

**Kidneys:**
The right kidney measures 11.2 cm in length with normal cortical thickness and echogenicity. Multiple small echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing are present consistent with renal calculi, largest measuring 3 mm in the lower pole. No hydronephrosis.

The left kidney measures 11.0 cm in length with normal cortical thickness. A 3 mm echogenic focus with shadowing consistent with a calculus is present in the mid-pole region. Anechoic parapelvic cysts are noted, largest measuring 1.5 cm, increased from 1.0 cm on prior CT (April 2006). No hydronephrosis.

**Aorta:**
The visualized proximal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Atherosclerotic calcifications are present.

**Inferior Vena Cava:**
Patent with normal respiratory variation.

### **Impression:**

1. **Cholelithiasis** without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

2. Bilateral renal calculi without hydronephrosis.

3. Hepatic steatosis.

4. Left renal parapelvic cysts.
