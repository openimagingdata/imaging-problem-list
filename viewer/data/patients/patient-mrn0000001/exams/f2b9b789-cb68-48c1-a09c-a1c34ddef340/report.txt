**Left Shoulder Radiograph (AP, Axillary, and Scapular Y Views)**

**Date of Exam:** May 22, 2021

**Technique:**
Three views of the left shoulder.

**Indication:**
60-year-old male with left shoulder pain and limited range of motion.

**Comparison:**
None available.

### **Findings:**

**Glenohumeral Joint:**
The glenohumeral joint space is preserved. The humeral head is positioned in a high-riding configuration with reduced acromiohumeral distance measuring approximately 6 mm, suggesting chronic rotator cuff pathology. No dislocation or subluxation.

**Calcifications:**
Amorphous calcifications are present in the region of the supraspinatus tendon insertion on the greater tuberosity, consistent with calcific tendonitis.

**Bones:**
The humeral head, glenoid, clavicle, and scapula demonstrate normal bone density without fracture or lytic lesion. Mild degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint with joint space narrowing and small osteophytes.

**Soft Tissues:**
The visualized soft tissues are unremarkable on radiograph.

**Acromioclavicular Joint:**
Mild degenerative changes as noted above.

### **Impression:**

1. **Calcific tendonitis** of the left shoulder, likely involving the supraspinatus tendon.

2. **High-riding humeral head** with reduced acromiohumeral distance (6 mm), suggesting chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy or partial tear.

3. Mild degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint.

**Recommendation:** Clinical correlation. If symptoms persist, consider MRI for further evaluation of rotator cuff integrity.
