### **Findings:**

**Lungs:**
The lungs are well expanded and clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No definite pulmonary nodule identified on radiograph.

**Cardiomediastinal Silhouette:**
The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Prominent mitral annular calcification is visible. Calcification of the coronary arteries is noted. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The aortic knob is prominent with a tortuous descending thoracic aorta, compatible with atherosclerotic disease.

**Hila:**
The hila are normal in size and contour.

**Pleura:**
No pleural thickening or effusion.

**Bones:**
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with flowing anterior osteophytes bridging multiple levels, consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. An old superior endplate compression fracture at T9 is noted, now appearing chronic/healed compared to April 2006. Healed fractures of the left 7th and 8th ribs are present posterolaterally with smooth callus formation. An old healed fracture of the left mid-clavicle is identified. Diffuse osteopenia is present.

**Soft Tissues:**
No soft tissue abnormality.
