**CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without Contrast**

**Technique:**
Serial helical 5 mm sections were obtained from the diaphragmatic domes through the symphysis pubis. No oral or intravenous contrast was administered.

**Indication:**
64-year-old male with history of kidney stones.

**Comparison:**
CT abdomen and pelvis, 8/26/2024.

### **Findings:**

**Lungs (bases):**
Lung bases are clear.

**Heart and Vasculature:**
The heart is normal in size. Mitral annular and coronary artery calcifications are noted. No pericardial fluid. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.

**Liver:**
Liver is diffusely hypoattenuating, suggesting hepatic steatosis. A 1.6 cm focal area of increased attenuation is present (image 24, series 2), etiology uncertain. Contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended. No biliary dilatation.

**Gallbladder and Biliary System:**
Gallbladder is unremarkable. No biliary ductal dilation.

**Pancreas:**
Normal in size and contour. No masses or calcifications identified.

**Spleen:**
Normal in size and attenuation. No focal lesions.

**Adrenal Glands:**
Normal in size and morphology bilaterally.

**Kidneys and Ureters:**
Bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi. Largest in right lower pole measures 3 mm. Largest on left in interpolar region measures 5 mm (image 41, series 2). Minimally increased calculus burden compared to prior. No hydronephrosis. No ureteral or bladder calculi. Peripelvic cysts in the left kidney.

**Bladder, Prostate, and Seminal Vesicles:**
Urinary bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland are unremarkable.

**Bowel:**
Non-opacified bowel is unremarkable. No bowel wall thickening or inflammatory changes.

**Lymph Nodes:**
No intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, or pelvic adenopathy.

**Bones:**
Degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Extensive osteopenia, especially in thoracic spine, with flowing osteophytes. Recommend correlation with clinical history for possible hematologic abnormality.

**Soft Tissues:**
No abnormal soft tissue masses or collections.

### **Impression:**

1. Bilateral nonobstructive renal calculi with minimally increased burden since prior CT. Diffuse osteopenia, most pronounced in thoracic spine, raising possibility of metabolic disorder associated with renal calculus formation.

2. Indeterminate 1.6 cm liver lesion. Recommend further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI.
