**CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without Contrast**

**Date of Exam:** November 3, 2022

**Technique:**
Contiguous 5 mm helical images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without administration of oral or intravenous contrast material.

**Indication:**
61-year-old male with history of nephrolithiasis, intermittent flank discomfort.

**Comparison:**
CT abdomen and pelvis, April 18, 2021.

### **Findings:**

**Lungs (bases):**
Visualized lung bases are clear. No consolidation or pleural effusion.

**Heart and Vasculature:**
Heart size is normal. Mitral annular and coronary artery calcifications are present. No pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta measures 4.2 cm in maximal diameter, representing mild fusiform aneurysmal dilation, increased from 4.0 cm on September 2007 chest CT. The descending thoracic and abdominal aorta demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications and are normal in caliber.

**Liver:**
Diffusely decreased hepatic attenuation consistent with moderate hepatic steatosis. A small 6 mm hypodense lesion is present in segment 6 (image 22, series 2), too small to characterize, likely representing a simple cyst. No other focal lesion. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

**Gallbladder and Biliary System:**
The gallbladder contains multiple small calculi measuring up to 7 mm. No gallbladder wall thickening. Common bile duct measures 4 mm.

**Pancreas:**
Normal in size and attenuation. No focal mass or ductal dilatation.

**Spleen:**
Normal in size at 10.5 cm craniocaudal dimension. No focal abnormality.

**Adrenal Glands:**
Unremarkable bilaterally.

**Kidneys and Ureters:**
Both kidneys are normal in size and demonstrate symmetric enhancement pattern. No hydronephrosis. A 2 mm non-obstructing calculus is present in the right lower pole. A 3 mm non-obstructing calculus is present in the left interpolar region. Small parapelvic cysts are noted in the left kidney, largest measuring 1.8 cm, increased from 1.5 cm on ultrasound (February 2007). No ureteral or bladder calculi identified.

**Bladder, Prostate, and Seminal Vesicles:**
Urinary bladder is normal. Prostate gland is mildly enlarged, estimated at 35 grams, slightly increased from 30 grams (April 2006). Seminal vesicles are unremarkable.

**Bowel:**
Non-distended bowel is unremarkable. Moderate sigmoid diverticulosis is present, increased from mild on prior exam (April 2006), without evidence of diverticulitis. No wall thickening or inflammatory changes.

**Lymph Nodes:**
No enlarged abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes.

**Bones:**
Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with anterior bridging osteophytes consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Old superior endplate compression fracture at T9, chronic in appearance. Healed fractures of the left 7th and 8th ribs posterolaterally. Diffuse osteopenia, particularly in the thoracic spine. A small sclerotic focus in the T7 vertebral body is stable, consistent with benign bone island.

**Soft Tissues:**
No abnormal masses or collections.

### **Impression:**

1. Bilateral non-obstructing renal calculi, stable to minimally increased in size compared to prior examination.

2. Cholelithiasis.

3. Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm, increased from 4.0 cm (September 2022), recommend clinical correlation and consideration of follow-up imaging.

4. Moderate hepatic steatosis. New small 6 mm liver lesion in segment 6, too small to characterize, likely simple cyst.

5. Diffuse osteopenia with DISH. Old T9 compression fracture and left 7th and 8th rib fractures, stable. Stable bone island in T7.

6. Moderate sigmoid diverticulosis, increased from prior, without acute diverticulitis.

7. Left renal parapelvic cysts, largest 1.8 cm, increased from 1.5 cm.
