History: flank pain, h/o stones

Technique: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.

Comparison: 06/04/2024

Comment:
The visualized portions of the lower lungs are clear. The heart is not enlarged, and no pericardial fluid is identified. Vascular calcifications are present, including at the mitral annulus and within the coronary arteries. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.

The liver appears diffusely decreased in attenuation, which is suggestive of fatty infiltration. The gallbladder is normally distended and shows no wall thickening or calcified stones. The biliary ducts are not dilated. The pancreas is normal in contour and demonstrates no focal abnormality. The spleen is normal in size. The adrenal glands are unremarkable.

Both kidneys demonstrate small nonobstructing calculi. Stable bilateral renal stones including right lower pole stone measuring approximately 3 mm and left interpolar region, measuring about 4–5 mm. There is no hydronephrosis. Small parapelvic cysts are present in the left kidney. No ureteral stones are seen. The urinary bladder is normal in contour. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear within normal limits.

The bowel is nondilated, and no areas of wall thickening or surrounding inflammatory change are noted.

There is no ascites. No enlarged abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes are identified.

The bones show advanced degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine. Flowing osteophytes are present, raising the possibility of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.

Impression:
Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi, similar in size and number compared to prior examinations. No evidence of obstruction.
