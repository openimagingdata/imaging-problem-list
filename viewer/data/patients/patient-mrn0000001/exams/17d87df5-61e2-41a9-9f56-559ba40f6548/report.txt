**MRI Brain Without and With Contrast**

**Date of Exam:** January 25, 2023

**Technique:**
Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the brain was performed without and with intravenous gadolinium contrast. Sequences include sagittal T1, axial T2, axial FLAIR, axial DWI, axial gradient echo, and post-contrast axial and coronal T1.

**Indication:**
62-year-old male with headaches and dizziness, rule out intracranial pathology.

**Comparison:**
None available.

### **Findings:**

**Brain Parenchyma:**
The brain parenchyma demonstrates mild generalized volume loss appropriate for age. Multiple scattered T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci are present in the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The largest focus measures 5 mm in the right frontal subcortical white matter. No acute infarction is identified on diffusion-weighted imaging.

No mass, hemorrhage, or abnormal enhancement. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.

**Ventricles and CSF Spaces:**
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with age-related volume loss. No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.

**Corpus Callosum:**
Normal in morphology and signal intensity.

**Brainstem and Cerebellum:**
The brainstem and cerebellum are normal in appearance. No mass or abnormal signal.

**Posterior Fossa:**
The cerebellar tonsils are in normal position. The fourth ventricle is normal. No Chiari malformation.

**Basal Cisterns:**
Patent and symmetric.

**Cranial Nerves:**
The visualized cranial nerves are unremarkable.

**Sella and Pituitary:**
The pituitary gland is normal in size and demonstrates homogeneous enhancement. The sella turcica is normal.

**Vascular Structures:**
Flow voids are preserved in the major intracranial arteries. No aneurysm or vascular malformation identified. The major dural venous sinuses are patent.

**Paranasal Sinuses and Mastoid Air Cells:**
The paranasal sinuses are well aerated. Mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The mastoid air cells are clear.

**Orbits:**
The globes, extraocular muscles, and optic nerves are normal. No orbital mass.

**Calvarium and Skull Base:**
No skull base or calvarial lesion. No fracture.

### **Impression:**

1. **Chronic small vessel ischemic disease** with scattered T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, consistent with microvascular ischemic changes.

2. Mild age-appropriate cerebral volume loss.

3. No acute intracranial abnormality, mass, or hemorrhage.

4. Mild maxillary sinus mucosal thickening, likely inflammatory.

**Clinical Correlation:**
Findings are consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease, likely related to the patient's known cardiovascular risk factors. No acute cause for the patient's symptoms identified. Clinical correlation recommended.
