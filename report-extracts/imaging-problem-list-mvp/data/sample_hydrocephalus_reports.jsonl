{"id": "rpt_001", "text": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST FINDINGS:Brain Parenchyma, Ventricular System, and Extra-Axial Spaces:Evolving right inferior cerebellar infarct involving the majority of the right PICA territory with increased associated edema and mild mass effect on the right dorsolateral medulla and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle. The lateral and third ventricles remain similar in size. No evidence of hydrocephalus at this time. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or new territorial infarct. Osseous and Extracranial Structures: No significant paranasal sinus disease. No orbital abnormality. IMPRESSION:1. Evolving acute to early subacute right PICA territory infarct with mildly increased associated edema. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or herniation 2. New partial effacement of the fourth ventricle without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus at this time. Recommend follow-up head CT given progressive edema and risk for future development of hydrocephalus."}
{"id": "rpt_002", "text": "Order Reason for Exam: Hydrocephalus Stroke, follow up Narrative: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST Referring clinician's provided indication for this examination in Epic: * Hydrocephalus; * Stroke, follow up TECHNIQUE: Multidetector-row CT of the head was performed without intravenous contrast using tailored dose modulation techniques. Images were reconstructed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. COMPARISON: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST FINDINGS: Brain Parenchyma: Redemonstration is large right PICA territory infarct with significant swelling resulting in complete effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract. There is also mild right cerebellar tonsillar descent. The mass effect is not significantly changed compared with the prior head CT. There are are new areas of confluent hypodensity within the infarct, likely reflecting petechial hemorrhage (HI2), Contrast staining from the prior CTA could contribute, but is considered less likely. No evidence of a new acute infarct. Ventricular System and Extra-Axial Spaces: Mild interval enlargement of the ventricles. For example, the bodies the lateral ventricles measure 10 mm in superior-inferior dimension on the right and 9 mm on the left, compared with 7 mm and 6 mm on the prior CT. The third ventricle now measures 8 mm, previously 5 mm. There is new slight dilatation of the temporal horns. No extra-axial collections. No midline shift. Osseous and Extracranial Structures: Normal. No significant paranasal sinus disease. No orbital abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. New areas of confluent hypodensity within the large right PICA territory infarct, likely reflecting petechial hemorrhage (HI2). 2. Similar mass effect resulting in complete effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract. 3. Mild interval enlargement of the lateral ventricles and third ventricle, likely early obstructive hydrocephalus."}

COMPARISON: CT head FINDINGS: Brain Parenchyma: Large area of diffusion restriction in the right cerebellar hemisphere involving the right PICA territory compatible with acute infarct. There is redemonstrated associated edema, resulting in partial effacement of the fourth ventricle and complete effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract. There is confluent areas of T1 isointense to slightly hyperintense signal throughout the infarcted region likely representing petechial hemorrhage (HI2). No new acute/subacute infarct. No evidence of mass lesion. Foci of periventricular and subcortical T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal which are nonspecific. Ventricular System and Extra-Axial Spaces: Effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract as described above. Interval slightly increased size of the lateral ventricles compared to prior exam. No evidence of midline shift. Extracranial Structures: Expected arterial flow signal is observed at the skull base. Unremarkable orbits. Clear paranasal sinuses. Mild bilateral mastoid effusions. IMPRESSION: 1.Redemonstrated acute infarct in the right cerebellar hemisphere involving the right PICA territory with petechial hemorrhage (HI2). 2.Associated edema resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract. Interval slightly increased size of the lateral ventricles compared to prior exam, suspicious for developing hydrocephalus."}
