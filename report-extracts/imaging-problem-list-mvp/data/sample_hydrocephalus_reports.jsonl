{“id”: “rpt_001” , “text” : FINDINGS: Brain Parenchyma, Ventricular System, and Extra-Axial Spaces:  Evolving right inferior cerebellar infarct involving the majority of the right PICA territory with increased associated edema and mild mass effect on the right dorsolateral medulla and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle. The lateral and third ventricles remain similar in size. No evidence of hydrocephalus at this time. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or new territorial infarct. Osseous and Extracranial Structures: No significant paranasal sinus disease. No orbital abnormality.  IMPRESSION:1.  Evolving acute to early subacute right PICA territory infarct with mildly increased associated edema. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or herniation 2.  New partial effacement of the fourth ventricle without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus at this time. Recommend follow-up head CT given progressive edema and risk for future development of hydrocephalus.”}
