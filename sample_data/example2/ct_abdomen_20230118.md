**CT Abdomen and Pelvis With Intravenous Contrast**

**Date of Exam:** January 18, 2023

**Technique:**
Helical 5 mm sections were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. No oral contrast was given.

**Indication:**
62-year-old male with left lower quadrant pain and fever, concern for diverticulitis.

**Comparison:**
CT abdomen and pelvis, November 3, 2022.

### **Findings:**

**Lungs (bases):**
The visualized lung bases are clear. No pleural effusion.

**Heart and Vasculature:**
The heart is normal in size. Mitral annular and coronary artery calcifications are present. No pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta measures 4.3 cm in maximal diameter, stable to slightly increased. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with atherosclerotic calcifications.

**Liver:**
The liver demonstrates diffuse decreased attenuation consistent with hepatic steatosis. The previously noted 6 mm hypodense lesion in segment 6 is again seen and unchanged. Normal hepatic and portal venous enhancement. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

**Gallbladder and Biliary System:**
Multiple gallstones are present within the gallbladder. No gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct measures 5 mm, within normal limits.

**Pancreas:**
Normal in size and demonstrates homogeneous enhancement. No pancreatic ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid.

**Spleen:**
Normal in size measuring 11 cm. Homogeneous enhancement. No focal lesions.

**Adrenal Glands:**
Normal bilaterally.

**Kidneys and Ureters:**
Both kidneys demonstrate normal size and symmetric enhancement. No hydronephrosis. Non-obstructing calculi are present bilaterally, stable. Right lower pole stone measures 3 mm. Left interpolar stone measures approximately 4 mm. Small parapelvic cysts in the left kidney measure up to 1.8 cm, stable. No ureteral or bladder stones.

**Bladder, Prostate, and Seminal Vesicles:**
The urinary bladder is partially distended and unremarkable. The prostate gland and seminal vesicles are within normal limits.

**Bowel:**
**Moderate sigmoid diverticulosis is present. There is wall thickening of the sigmoid colon with pericolonic fat stranding consistent with acute diverticulitis.** No pneumoperitoneum. No drainable fluid collection or abscess. The remainder of the bowel is unremarkable.

**Lymph Nodes:**
A few mildly prominent pericolic lymph nodes are present, likely reactive. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or pelvic lymph nodes.

**Bones:**
Degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine with flowing anterior osteophytes consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Old superior endplate compression fracture at T9, unchanged. Healed left 7th and 8th rib fractures. Diffuse osteopenia. Stable sclerotic focus in T7 vertebral body.

**Soft Tissues:**
Pericolonic inflammatory stranding as described above. No other abnormal soft tissue masses or fluid collections. No ascites.

### **Impression:**

1. **Acute sigmoid diverticulitis** with pericolonic inflammatory changes. No abscess or perforation identified.

2. Moderate sigmoid diverticulosis.

3. Bilateral non-obstructing renal calculi, stable.

4. Cholelithiasis.

5. Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 4.3 cm, stable to minimally increased.

6. Hepatic steatosis with stable 6 mm liver lesion, likely simple cyst.

7. DISH with old T9 compression fracture. Stable bone island in T7.

**Recommendation:** Clinical management of acute diverticulitis. Follow-up imaging after treatment to document resolution of inflammatory changes.
