**CT Chest Without Contrast**

**Date of Exam:** September 22, 2022

**Technique:**
Helical acquisition with 5 mm sections from the lung apices through the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.

**Indication:**
61-year-old male with history of chronic cough, rule out pulmonary pathology.

**Comparison:**
Chest radiograph, March 15, 2022.

### **Findings:**

**Lungs and Airways:**
The lungs are well expanded and clear. No consolidation, interstitial thickening, or ground-glass opacity. A 4 mm solid pulmonary nodule is present in the right lower lobe lateral basal segment (image 42, series 2). Mild linear scarring is noted in the right lower lobe medial basilar segment, likely sequela of prior pneumonia (June 2006). No additional nodules identified. The airways are patent without bronchial wall thickening.

**Pleura:**
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

**Mediastinum and Hila:**
The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. A few borderline enlarged lymph nodes are present in the right hilum, largest measuring 11 mm in short axis, likely reactive. No pathologic lymphadenopathy by size criteria. The thymus is involuted, age-appropriate.

**Heart and Pericardium:**
The heart is normal in size. Mitral annular calcification is prominent. Coronary artery calcifications are present. No pericardial effusion or thickening.

**Vasculature:**
The ascending aorta measures 4.0 cm in maximal diameter with fusiform configuration, representing mild aneurysmal dilation. The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are normal in caliber with atherosclerotic calcifications. The main pulmonary artery measures 2.8 cm. No pulmonary embolism identified (unenhanced study, limited evaluation).

**Esophagus:**
Normal caliber without wall thickening.

**Bones:**
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with anterior bridging osteophytes consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Old superior endplate compression fracture at T9, chronic appearing. Healed fractures of the left 7th and 8th ribs are present along the posterior axillary line with callus formation. An old healed fracture of the left clavicle at the mid-shaft is identified with smooth corticated margins. Diffuse osteopenia is present, particularly severe in the thoracic spine. A small sclerotic focus in the T7 vertebral body measuring 8 mm is stable compared to August 2005, consistent with benign bone island.

**Shoulders:**
The left glenohumeral joint demonstrates a moderate joint effusion. The humeral head is in a high-riding position with reduced acromiohumeral distance. Calcifications are noted in the region of the rotator cuff insertion at the greater tuberosity, compatible with known calcific tendonitis (May 2006 radiograph).

**Chest Wall and Soft Tissues:**
No chest wall mass or abnormal soft tissue collection.

**Upper Abdomen:**
Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate hepatic steatosis. The visualized spleen is normal. Cholelithiasis is present.

### **Impression:**

1. **4 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe.** In a patient with no known malignancy and low risk factors, recommend follow-up CT in 12 months per Fleischner Society guidelines.

2. Mild linear scarring in right lower lobe, sequela of prior pneumonia (June 2021).

3. Borderline enlarged right hilar lymph nodes, largest 11 mm, likely reactive. No pathologic adenopathy.

4. Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 4.0 cm, stable compared to recent abdominal CT.

5. **Left glenohumeral joint effusion** with high-riding humeral head and rotator cuff calcifications, consistent with acute flare of calcific tendonitis. Clinical correlation recommended.

6. Extensive DISH with osteopenia. Old T9 compression fracture. Healed left 7th and 8th rib fractures and left clavicular fracture.

7. Stable sclerotic focus in T7 vertebral body, consistent with benign bone island.

8. Cholelithiasis and hepatic steatosis on limited upper abdominal views.
