### **Findings:**

**Lungs:**
There is a focal airspace opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia. No cavitation. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

**Cardiomediastinal Silhouette:**
The heart size is normal. Mitral annular calcification is present. Mild coronary artery calcification. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The aortic knob is mildly prominent.

**Hila:**
Normal hilar contours bilaterally.

**Pleura:**
No pleural abnormality.

**Bones:**
Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with flowing anterior bridging osteophytes consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). An acute-appearing superior endplate compression fracture is present at T9. Healed fractures of the left 7th and 8th ribs are noted posterolaterally. An old healed left mid-clavicular fracture is identified. Moderate osteopenia.

**Soft Tissues:**
Unremarkable.

### **Impression:**

1. **Right lower lobe pneumonia.** Clinical correlation and treatment recommended. Follow-up radiograph after treatment to document resolution.

2. Cardiac calcifications.

3. DISH with extensive degenerative changes. Acute T9 compression fracture. Healed left 7th and 8th rib fractures and left clavicular fracture.

4. Osteopenia.
